TASK 1 :TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

The legendary tale of the Titanic transcends mere tragedy, offering a treasure trove of data-driven insights. During my internship at ENCRYPTIX, I embarked on a captivating mission: predicting passenger survival rates through rigorous data analysis.

This project delved deeper than simply numbers. It was about unraveling the intricate tapestry of factors that influenced survival, uncovering hidden patterns within historical records. I delved into data cleaning, analysis, and model building, gaining valuable experience in:

1️⃣ Data Exploration and Understanding: I honed my skills in assessing and preparing datasets for analysis.

2️⃣ Feature Engineering: I transformed raw data into meaningful features to train effective models.

3️⃣ Model Selection and Evaluation: I experimented with various models to achieve the most accurate predictions.

4️⃣ User Interface Creation: I built a user-friendly model for survival prediction.

Encountering Unforeseen Challenges

The project wasn't without its challenges. Just like the perilous icebergs the Titanic encountered, unforeseen hurdles arose, demanding adaptability and resourcefulness. It was during these moments that I honed my ability to think critically and find solutions under pressure, solidifying my problem-solving skills.

Emerging with Valuable Skills

This internship at Encryptix transcended mere competition. It served as a springboard, propelling me towards future endeavors in the ever-evolving field of data science.
